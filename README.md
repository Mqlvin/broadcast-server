### Broadcast Server
This is a project which will allow me to quickly make (insecure) websocket servers to prototyping games.
You specify logic for servers, extending an abstract server class.

#### Note
This is my first time using `TypeScript` and still one of my first projects with `node.js`, so I apologise for any back code practices.
I appreciate the codebase is quite messy, I had a short time to make it and I just needed it to work :)
